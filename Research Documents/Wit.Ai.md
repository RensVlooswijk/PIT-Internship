# Introduction

Wit.ai is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that enables developers to create conversational interfaces, chatbots, and voice assistants. Wit.ai was founded in 2013 and acquired by Facebook in 2015. Since then, it has become a popular NLP platform used by many developers to build intelligent bots and applications.

# Features

Wit.ai provides a variety of features that make it easy to build conversational interfaces. These features include:

## Natural Language Processing

Wit.ai's NLP capabilities allow it to understand the meaning behind user inputs. It uses machine learning algorithms to extract relevant entities and intents from user input, which can be used to trigger specific actions or responses.

## Entity Extraction

Wit.ai can extract relevant entities from user input such as names, dates, and locations. This allows developers to build more intelligent bots that can recognize and respond to specific user requests.

## Intent Detection

Wit.ai can detect the intent behind user input. This allows developers to create bots that can understand what users want and provide appropriate responses.

## Context Awareness

Wit.ai can maintain context between user inputs. This allows developers to build bots that can remember previous interactions and provide personalized responses.

## Training

Wit.ai provides an easy-to-use training interface that allows developers to teach their bots how to recognize different intents and entities. Developers can upload sample conversations, which Wit.ai uses to train its algorithms.

# Integration

Wit.ai can be integrated with a variety of platforms and programming languages. It provides SDKs for many popular languages, including Python, Node.js, and Ruby. Wit.ai can also be integrated with platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Twilio.
