# Introduction

Inworld.AI is an innovative tool that enables developers to create characters with personalities and dialogue using AI. This tool has quickly gained popularity since its founding in 2020, and it allows users to import these characters into Unity to create conversational NPCs.

# Features

Inworld.AI offers several features that make it easy to create conversational NPCs, including:

## Natural Language Processing

One of Inworld.AI's most notable features is its advanced NLP capabilities. This feature enables characters to understand user inputs by using machine learning algorithms to extract relevant entities and intents from user input. The extracted information can be used to trigger specific actions or responses from the NPC.

## Character Customization

Inworld.AI allows developers to customize the characters they create with unique personalities and dialogues. This feature makes it possible to create engaging and interactive conversational experiences for users.

## Dialogue Tree

Inworld.AI's dialogue tree interface is another valuable feature that enables developers to create complex conversational flows. This feature makes it possible to create interactive conversations that can adapt to user input, creating a more engaging and immersive experience for users.

## Unity Integration

Inworld.AI characters can easily be imported into Unity, making it possible to create conversational NPCs in games and other applications.

# Limitations

While Inworld.AI offers several impressive features, one significant limitation is that it only understands the English language. Therefore, it may not be a suitable tool for projects that require support for other languages, such as Dutch.

## Education

Educators can use Inworld.AI to create conversational experiences that help students learn and engage with educational material. This feature makes learning more interactive and engaging for students.

# Personal Experience

I have personally experimented with Inworld.AI and created a demo environment to showcase how the product could work in my project. However, I discovered that the tool only supports the English language, which is a significant limitation that undermines the purpose of my project. My project requires NPC behavior and unscripted dialogue in multiple languages. Therefore, while Inworld.AI may be useful for English-language applications, it is not suitable for my project.

# Conclusion

Inworld.AI is an innovative tool that offers advanced NLP capabilities, character customization, dialogue tree features, and Unity integration, making it easy to create conversational NPCs. However, its limitation to only understanding the English language may make it unsuitable for projects that require support for other languages. Despite this limitation, Inworld.AI is an excellent tool for developers seeking to create engaging and immersive conversational experiences for users.
