## The Assignment
![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/csm_pit-visual_41fefac88a.png)

### Context

Practoraat interactieve technologie is an institution within ROC Tilburg that focuses on interactive technology. The company provides education and training in various fields related to technology, including virtual and augmented reality. Rudy, my stakeholder, and client, is a Dutch teacher at ROC Tilburg for refugee students. The reason for the assignment is that the students of the Dutch teacher have trouble speaking Dutch. They practice this by having conversations with each other, but the teacher needs to be present to correct and help them. This makes it impossible for multiple people to practice at the same time. A VR would help students practice conversations on their own. Since they could practice at home, and it is more interesting. The students have also had a previous VR experience which was received very well.

### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to provide a virtual environment for students to practice their Dutch language skills in a restaurant setting. The problem that needs to be solved is that students require a teacher's presence to correct them during their language practice sessions. This results in limited opportunities for multiple students to practice speaking Dutch at the same time. The desired situation is to have a virtual environment where students can practice their language skills on their own and receive feedback in real-time.

The benefits of the project include improved language skills, increased confidence while speaking, and the ability to practice speaking Dutch anytime and anywhere. The VR restaurant game will offer students the possibility of having realistic conversations with a virtual waiter and provide an immersive learning experience. The product or project result will offer the capability of practicing language skills in a virtual environment and provide the facility of real-time 

### The Assignemnt
Develop a virtual reality game to teach Dutch language to refugees at ROC Tilburg, improving language proficiency, engagement, motivation, and success, aging 18 to 50.

## Research Questions

### Main Question: 
> How effective is virtual reality technology in teaching Dutch language to the students, and what are the best practices for designing and developing a virtual reality game for this purpose?

A lot of research has been done with the goal of answering a similar question. Because from the moment VR headsets were publically available people have seen its potention in education. But for this specific use-case there is no concrete answer. This is why I made a prove of concept and a minimal viable product, To see if the refugee students of "het schakelcollege" would benefit from using virtual reality in their education. And my answer is Yes, it helps. Atleast the MVP I made. The students really enjoyed it and were really engaged. The only problem with my research is that it is a combination of both VR and AI. Because in this case I am not 100% sure the VR was contributing a lot or if it was all by the game/AI itself.

### Sub Questions:

#### 1.	
> What is the current state of research on the use of virtual reality technology in language learning, and how does it compare to traditional language learning methods in terms of effectiveness and engagement?

Currently VR in education is a growing field, both in general and as a language learning tool. However it is still very much evolving and improving. Also its effectiveness is not set in stone yet. But it seems to be a large improvement (mostly in engagement) compared to learning from books. 

### 2.	
> What are the specific challenges and considerations when using virtual reality technology for language learning, particularly for the students?

Besides the general flaws of VR like motion sickness for some students, I think the main challenge would be the lack of actual human interaction. Because while VR can simulate environments it currently is not able to fully replicate the nuances of human interaction (mostly non-verbal). In VR body language is often simplified and thus cant show the complexity of real-world interactions. So a student would have difficulty picking up non verbal clues. However for learning a second language this is not as important so in this use case there are no real downsides.

### 3.	
> How can we evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual reality game in terms of language proficiency and engagement, and what are the best practices for gathering feedback from the students?

The most obvious way would be user test and ask feedback in a questionnaire format. This is also what I did. (to see my questionnaire please click [this link](https://forms.gle/emxx9nvhDpR23vZc7)). Although I am not convinced this is the best method to check the effectiveness of VR in language learning. During my internship I came across another method that I liked a lot. Using this method you would get 2 students to fill in a quiz about a subject neither have actual knowledge about. Then you would let one of them play the VR game and one person study with a book. Then they would take the quiz again and you would see if VR is effective. You could also let one person do both.

### 4.	
> What are the key steps and best practices for creating a successful proof of concept for a new product or technology?



Creating a successful proof of concept involves several key steps:

- Identify the problem: Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve and how your new product or technology can address it.  
- Define success criteria: Determine what outcomes would indicate success for your proof of concept.  
- Develop a prototype: Create a simplified version of your product or technology that focuses on testing the core functionality.  
- Test and gather feedback: Use your prototype to test your assumptions and gather feedback from potential users.  
- Analyze results and make decisions: Based on the feedback and results of your tests, make decisions about whether and how to proceed with development.

Best practices include involving potential users in the testing and feedback process, being open to negative feedback and ready to make changes, and focusing on learning and improvement rather than trying to get everything perfect in the initial version.

## Learning Outcomes

To see more detailed / explained versions of the learning outcomes check out [Learning Outcomes Explained](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/Learning%20Outcomes%20Explained.md#learning-outcomes-explained)

### 1. Professional Duties
> You carry out the professional duties on a junior bachelor level resulting in professional products in line with the IT-area you are working in.
> Professional duties on a junior bachelor level = All or a subset of the activities Analysis, Design, Realize, Advise, Manage & Control. As a reference use: 1) the HBO-I framework on proficiency level 2, 2) the level as >required in OE3 or OE4

I have actively worked on this learning outcome, and I have categorized it into different aspects:

#### Analysis
For the analysis part of my professional duties I started by creating a [project plan](Project Plan) which included multiple aspects of preparation like my requirements"

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/Requirements.png)

And an idea of the finished product:

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/EndProductTree.png)

#### Realize
To see my realization of the project you can of course see the entire project within this GitHub page. But for my portfolio I will give a short summary of the things I have done.
It starts with the multiple options I had to realize the project. Check out this link [too see all my research](/Documents) . But when I started with this project I found a tool called Inworld.Ai. which I then used to create a demo scene.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/InworldAIDemoPhoto.png)

However this was not optimal as a final product as you can read in my [inworld.ai research](Documents/InworldAi.md) . So I set out to find a different method. Which ended up being a combination of different API's.
It works as followed: When the player starts to speak I start an audio recording which ends when the players stops speaking. I then save this file and send it to the [Whisper API](Docuements/Whisper.md) which transcribes what is said. This API then sends back a text file that I in turn send to the [ChatGPT API](Documents/ChatGPT%20API.md) . This then formulates an answer based on how I prompted the GPT chat beforehand. Finally I will send this answer to the [11Labs API](Documents/11Labs.md) which will speak the text in a voice to my choosing.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/StartRecordingCode.png)

This works but there are some drawbacks as well like the time it takes to get a spoken response. This is why I made a startup scene where you can select which version you would like to use

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/MenuScene.png)

This way the user can choose on their own which fits best for their use case.

#### Advice
As for the advice, I receive weekly feedback from my stakeholder and school assessor. Which is very useful. Furthermore whenever I was not sure or have a question about something I made I went to other students and my internship coordinators.
Also, when I hand something in for school I received feedback which I then implemented before I handed it in again.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/FeedbackLogProjectPlanv2.png)

#### Manage & Control 
Finally for the manage and control parts of my professional duties I have done several things. The first being a project plan. At the start of my internship I created multiple iterations of a project plan. I also kept track of my progress using Trello in combination with the Agile work methods.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/TrelloBacklog.png)![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/TrelloDone.png)

And lastly I used GitHub as my version control tool. Whenever I added something new I pushed it to my repository to keep track.

### 2. Situation Orientation
> You apply your previously acquired knowledge and skills in an authentic context to deliver relevant results for the project and company.

For my situation orientation I have applied a lot of knowledge and skills that I aquired in previous semesters. In semester 3 for example, we learned what an API was and how to use them. I used this knowledge to create the dynamically layered method using the [whisper](/Documents/Whisper.md), [ChatGPT](/Documents/ChatGPT%20API.md) and [11labs](/Documents/11Labs.md) API's.
