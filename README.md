## The Assignment
![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/assets/73878099/c4c3a80f-3b3b-427b-a6b1-655c95d8fe66)

### Context

Practoraat interactieve technologie is an institution within ROC Tilburg that focuses on interactive technology. The company provides education and training in various fields related to technology, including virtual and augmented reality. Rudy, my stakeholder, and client, is a Dutch teacher at ROC Tilburg for refugee students. The reason for the assignment is that the students of the Dutch teacher have trouble speaking Dutch. They practice this by having conversations with each other, but the teacher needs to be present to correct and help them. This makes it impossible for multiple people to practice at the same time. A VR would help students practice conversations on their own. Since they could practice at home, and it is more interesting. The students have also had a previous VR experience which was received very well.

### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to provide a virtual environment for students to practice their Dutch language skills in a restaurant setting. The problem that needs to be solved is that students require a teacher's presence to correct them during their language practice sessions. This results in limited opportunities for multiple students to practice speaking Dutch at the same time. The desired situation is to have a virtual environment where students can practice their language skills on their own and receive feedback in real-time.

The benefits of the project include improved language skills, increased confidence while speaking, and the ability to practice speaking Dutch anytime and anywhere. The VR restaurant game will offer students the possibility of having realistic conversations with a virtual waiter and provide an immersive learning experience. The product or project result will offer the capability of practicing language skills in a virtual environment and provide the facility of real-time 

### The Assignemnt
Develop a virtual reality game to teach Dutch language to refugees at ROC Tilburg, improving language proficiency, engagement, motivation, and success, aging 18 to 50.

## Research Questions

Main Question: How effective is virtual reality technology in teaching Dutch language to the students, and what are the best practices for designing and developing a virtual reality game for this purpose?
1.	What is the current state of research on the use of virtual reality technology in language learning, and how does it compare to traditional language learning methods in terms of effectiveness and engagement?
2.	What are the specific challenges and considerations when using virtual reality technology for language learning, particularly for the students?
3.	How can we evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual reality game in terms of language proficiency and engagement, and what are the best practices for gathering feedback from the students?
4.	What are the key steps and best practices for creating a successful proof of concept for a new product or technology?
