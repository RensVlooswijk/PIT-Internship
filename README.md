## The Assignment
![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/csm_pit-visual_41fefac88a.png)

### Context

Practoraat interactieve technologie is an institution within ROC Tilburg that focuses on interactive technology. The company provides education and training in various fields related to technology, including virtual and augmented reality. Rudy, my stakeholder, and client, is a Dutch teacher at ROC Tilburg for refugee students. The reason for the assignment is that the students of the Dutch teacher have trouble speaking Dutch. They practice this by having conversations with each other, but the teacher needs to be present to correct and help them. This makes it impossible for multiple people to practice at the same time. A VR would help students practice conversations on their own. Since they could practice at home, and it is more interesting. The students have also had a previous VR experience which was received very well.

### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to provide a virtual environment for students to practice their Dutch language skills in a restaurant setting. The problem that needs to be solved is that students require a teacher's presence to correct them during their language practice sessions. This results in limited opportunities for multiple students to practice speaking Dutch at the same time. The desired situation is to have a virtual environment where students can practice their language skills on their own and receive feedback in real-time.

The benefits of the project include improved language skills, increased confidence while speaking, and the ability to practice speaking Dutch anytime and anywhere. The VR restaurant game will offer students the possibility of having realistic conversations with a virtual waiter and provide an immersive learning experience. The product or project result will offer the capability of practicing language skills in a virtual environment and provide the facility of real-time 

### The Assignment
Develop a virtual reality game to teach Dutch language to refugees at ROC Tilburg, improving language proficiency, engagement, motivation, and success, aging 18 to 50.

### Main Question: 
> How effective is virtual reality technology in teaching Dutch language to the students, and what are the best practices for designing and developing a virtual reality game for this purpose?

A lot of research has been done with the goal of answering a similar question. Because from the moment VR headsets were publicly available people have seen its potential in education. But for this specific use-case there is no concrete answer. This is why I made a prove of concept and a minimal viable product, To see if the refugee students of "het Schakelcollege" would benefit from using virtual reality in their education. And my answer is Yes, it helps. At least the MVP I made. The students really enjoyed it and were really engaged. The only problem with my research is that it is a combination of both VR and AI. Because in this case I am not 100% sure the VR was contributing a lot or if it was all by the game/AI itself.

### Sub Questions:

#### 1.	
> What is the current state of research on the use of virtual reality technology in language learning, and how does it compare to traditional language learning methods in terms of effectiveness and engagement?

Currently VR in education is a growing field, both in general and as a language learning tool. However it is still very much evolving and improving. Also its effectiveness is not set in stone yet. But it seems to be a large improvement (mostly in engagement) compared to learning from books. 

### 2.	
> What are the specific challenges and considerations when using virtual reality technology for language learning, particularly for the students?

Besides the general flaws of VR like motion sickness for some students, I think the main challenge would be the lack of actual human interaction. Because while VR can simulate environments it currently is not able to fully replicate the nuances of human interaction (mostly non-verbal). In VR body language is often simplified and thus cant show the complexity of real-world interactions. So a student would have difficulty picking up non verbal clues. However for learning a second language this is not as important so in this use case there are no real downsides.

### 3.	
> How can we evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual reality game in terms of language proficiency and engagement, and what are the best practices for gathering feedback from the students?

The most obvious way would be user test and ask feedback in a questionnaire format. This is also what I did. (to see my questionnaire please click [this link](https://forms.gle/emxx9nvhDpR23vZc7)). Although I am not convinced this is the best method to check the effectiveness of VR in language learning. During my internship I came across another method that I liked a lot. Using this method you would get 2 students to fill in a quiz about a subject neither have actual knowledge about. Then you would let one of them play the VR game and one person study with a book. Then they would take the quiz again and you would see if VR is effective. You could also let one person do both.

### 4.	
> What are the key steps and best practices for creating a successful proof of concept for a new product or technology?

To create a successful proof of concept you need to involve several steps:

- Identify the problem: Start by making sure you have a good understanding of the problem that you are trying to solve, and how your project can address it.
- Definition of success: In semester 3 we learned about the definition of done, which is really similar. But it means to know beforehand when your proof of concept is successful.
- Develop a prototype: Create a simple but working version of your project that only focuses on the main functionality.
- Test and gather feedback: Follow this up by using the prototype to test your project and get feedback.
- Analyze results and make decisions: And finally you need to make decisions about whether you want to proceed based on given feedback.

These are the steps I found to be the most useful for me. This helped me create a proper proof of concept. After which I started with a MVP but there was not enough time in my semester to complete that as much as I originally wanted.

## Learning Outcomes

To see more detailed / explained versions of the learning outcomes check out [Learning Outcomes Explained](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/Learning%20Outcomes%20Explained.md#learning-outcomes-explained)

### 1. Professional Duties
> You carry out the professional duties on a junior bachelor level resulting in professional products in line with the IT-area you are working in.
> Professional duties on a junior bachelor level = All or a subset of the activities Analysis, Design, Realize, Advise, Manage & Control. As a reference use: 1) the HBO-I framework on proficiency level 2, 2) the level as >required in OE3 or OE4

I have actively worked on this learning outcome, and I have categorized it into different aspects:

#### Analysis
For the analysis part of my professional duties I started by creating a [project plan](Project Plan) which included multiple aspects of preparation like my requirements"

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/Requirements.png)

And an idea of the finished product:

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/EndProductTree.png)

#### Design
Before I started working in unity I first worked on a design. Both actual visual design and product design. Like the product tree as seen above any my [One Page Design Document](/Documents/One%20Page%20Design%20Document.md). And I created some sketches of what I thought the end product should look like:

![Image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/WaiterSketch4%20(Custom).png)![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/SketchWaiter3%20(Custom).png) ![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/WaiterSketch1%20(Custom).png)

The end product does not look exactly the same as I predicted ofcourse but it did help me shape an idea in my head and work towards that.

#### Realize
To see my realization of the project you can of course see the entire project within this GitHub page. But for my portfolio I will give a short summary of the things I have done.
It starts with the multiple options I had to realize the project. Check out this link [too see all my research](/Documents) . But when I started with this project I found a tool called Inworld.Ai. which I then used to create a demo scene.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/InworldDemoAsAGif.gif)

However this was not optimal as a final product as you can read in my [inworld.ai research](Documents/InworldAi.md) . So I set out to find a different method. Which ended up being a combination of different API's.
It works as followed: When the player starts to speak I start an audio recording which ends when the players stops speaking. I then save this file and send it to the [Whisper API](Docuements/Whisper.md) which transcribes what is said. This API then sends back a text file that I in turn send to the [ChatGPT API](Documents/ChatGPT%20API.md) . This then formulates an answer based on how I prompted the GPT chat beforehand. Finally I will send this answer to the [11Labs API](Documents/11Labs.md) which will speak the text in a voice to my choosing.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/StartRecordingCode.png)

This works but there are some drawbacks as well like the time it takes to get a spoken response. This is why I made a startup scene where you can select which version you would like to use

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/MenuScene.png)

This way the user can choose on their own which fits best for their use case.

#### Advice
As for the advice, I receive weekly feedback from my stakeholder and school assessor. Which is very useful. Furthermore whenever I was not sure or have a question about something I made I went to other students and my internship coordinators.
Also, when I hand something in for school I received feedback which I then implemented before I handed it in again.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/FeedbackLogProjectPlanv2.png)

#### Manage & Control 
Finally for the manage and control parts of my professional duties I have done several things. The first being a project plan. At the start of my internship I created multiple iterations of a project plan. I also kept track of my progress using Trello in combination with the Agile work methods.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/TrelloBacklog.png)![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/TrelloDone.png)

And lastly I used GitHub as my version control tool. Whenever I added something new I pushed it to my repository to keep track.

### 2. Situation Orientation
> You apply your previously acquired knowledge and skills in an authentic context to deliver relevant results for the project and company.

For my situation orientation I have applied a lot of knowledge and skills that I acquired in previous semesters. In semester 3 for example, we learned what an API was and how to use them. I used this knowledge to create the dynamically layered method using the [whisper](/Documents/Whisper.md), [ChatGPT](/Documents/ChatGPT%20API.md) and [11labs](/Documents/11Labs.md) API's. 

During my internship at PIT, I've applied a wide range of knowledge and skills that I've acquired during my previous semesters to create a working unity project with advanced technical aspects.

#### Game Design and Unity Development:

In my 4th semester I did the Game Design & Technology specialization. In which I learned the main principles and methods of creating a game. Like a [One Page Design](/Documents/One%20Page%20Design%20Document.md) and a [Design Challenge](/documents/DesignChallenge). This allowed me to properly plan out my project and this helped me to create this VR / educational / enjoyable product.

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/Schermafbeelding%202023-06-07%20134349.png)

This was complimented by my foundation of Unity game development I got during this semester. This was essential in the creation of my game in every aspect.

#### API Integration:

Then there was my 3rd semester (Software) in which I learned a lot about what an API is and how to use them. This knowledge was put to good use too in this project. I used the [Whisper API](Docuements/Whisper.md) for voice recognition, the [ChatGPT API](Documents/ChatGPT%20API.md) for generating AI responses, and the [11Labs API](/Documents/11Labs.md) for converting text responses to speech. By combining these APIs, I was able to create a game experience where the students can have real-time conversations with AI characters.

### 3. Future-Oriented Organization
> You explore the organizational context of your project, make business, sustainable and ethical considerations and manage all aspects of the execution of the project.

**Exploring Organizational Context**:
The first day I started as an intern I was given a presentation and explanation of the organizational context of both ROC Tilburg and PIT. This helped me know who to go for if I needed help. I also kept close contact with the people that were important for me within the organization, like Erdinç, Daan and Rudy, through weekly meetings.

**Business, Sustainable, and Ethical Considerations**:
Furthermore, my vision of the project was always forward-looking, as I was constantly looking for new technologies and had scalability in mind. I also created a internship takeover document so that my project can be taken over after my internship ends. During the project I also considered the cost-effectiveness, as I made sure to use API's and tools that were free, cheap and or scalable.

**Managing the Project**:
I feel like I managed my project effectively by using all the proper tools like Trello and GitHub. I also showed my project on several occasions to my stakeholders and used their feedback to troubleshoot the issues.

### 4. Investigative Problem Solving
> You take a critical look at your project from different perspectives, identify problems, find an effective approach and arrive at appropriate solutions.

When I first came to PIT I had conversations with some of the teachers, and one of the projects they had to offer really stood out to me. There had already been a problem analysis so I didn't have to identify the problems (of the real life problem) anymore. However I took a critical look at the solutions that were possible. After this we decided on a VR game where you can have a dynamic conversation. 

During my internship this posed some problems. The main one of course being: what is the best way to create a conversational non-player character (NPC). This inspired my next research sessions, the [Option Research](/Documents/OptionResearch.md). During my research I found multiple ways to solve my problem including: Inworld AI, Windows Speech recognition and a combination of API's. Then I followed this up with separate research on each option and came to some conclusions and solutions which can be found in said option research. It also further shows my problem identifying this semester since with each possible option there were pro's and con's .

### 5. Personal Leadership 
> You are entrepreneurial around your projects and personal development, you pay attention to your own learning ability and keep in mind what kind of IT professional and/or what type of positions you aspire to.

This learning outcome I tackled by doing as much as possible for my internship company outside of my main project. Like go to events like the [Fontys XR event](), [Fontys VR Expo]() and the [AI IT Festival](). I thought these events were very educational and my internship appreciated me going. I also spend 1 day a week at Aero, a student team for the TU, for my internship. Furthermore if there were questions about a new tool which needed to be tested I was eager to do so most of the time, Especially if it was AI related. 

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/AeroLogo.png)

![image](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/PIT-Internship/blob/Dev/PortfolioAssets/fontys-it-festival%20(Small).jpg)

Also, during my internship I really liked to lead a project and or arrange to go to these events with other interns, and this inspired me to run for president/board member for my study association [Salve Mundi](salvemundi.nl) for next year.

[Return to table of contents](#table-of-contents) 

### 6. Targeted Interaction 
> You determine which partners play a role in your project, collaborate constructively with them and communicate appropriately to achieve the desired impact.

For this learning outcome we made a good start by planning a weekly meeting with my stakeholder, assessor and internship manager. This really helped smooth my project along during the entirety of my internship. This also helped me improve my communication skills tremendously.

I kept the people involved up to date as much as possible and all the communication was friendly and constructive. There were also other teacher that I had contact with, for example English teachers since they heard about my project and thought it could be useful for them as well.
Then there was the communication with my possible successor. Since this project is not finished when I end my internship, it can be continued by a new intern. This is why I had to conversation with a potential intern at PIT who was interested in my project. And last but not least I gave multiple demo's to all the other interns to share experiences and ideas.
