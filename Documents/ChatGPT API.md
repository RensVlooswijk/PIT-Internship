## Findings and Results

### ChatGPT API Quality
Since I had already used ChatGPT before I knew roughly what it could do. Nevertheless I was still impressed. It was able to simulate a real person really well. Also the speed of the API was impressive as it gave an answer almost instantly.

### Limitations
ChatGPT has, as far as I found, no real limitations in and of itself. However when you want to use it in a game like me there are other limiting factors. Because method of using ChatGPT as an NPC required some other API's and elements like, the [Whisper](/Whisper.md) API and the [11Labs](11Labs.md) API. This made this method relatively slow.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, The ChatGPT API is amazing and very useful for a lot of things. This is why I will be using it in my final project. However there are still some downsides for now, for which I will have to find workarounds.
