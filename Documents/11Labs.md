# Research Document: 11 labs

---

## Introduction

### Background
11labs the leading provider of text-to-speech (TTS) technology, offering high-quality synthetic voices that closely resemble human speech. Their TTS system has gained popularity for its ability to convert written text into natural-sounding audio.

### Research Question
For my project I would like to know how well 11labs' text-to-speech technology is in producing human-like voices. Additionally, I also aim to explore the limitations of the system, particularly regarding its lack of support for the Dutch language.

### Objectives
- Assess the quality of 11labs' text-to-speech.
- Check if it is possible to use in Dutch.

## Findings and Results

### Text-to-Speech Quality
The evaluation of 11labs' TTS system revealed a high level of quality and naturalness in the generated speech across the supported languages, such as English, French, and German. The synthesized voices exhibited good prosody and pronunciation, making them suitable for various applications.

### Limitations in Dutch Language Support
Unfortunately, a significant limitation of 11labs' text-to-speech technology is its lack of support for the Dutch language. This poses a challenge for projects that require Dutch speech synthesis, as the system is unable to accurately render Dutch text into human-like speech.

## Discussion
The findings demonstrate that 11 labs is very effective and the quality is amazing in multiple languages. However, not in Dutch. Which is a major concern for my project

---

## Conclusion
In conclusion, 11Labs' text to speech system is amazing for high quality/natural sounding voices. This is why I am going to use it to create a version of my project to demonstrate. However it cant be the solution that will used for my final product since I really need my text to speech to be able to speak Dutch.
