# Transfer Document for Table Talk

## Introduction
This document is to ensure if another person wants to continue with this project he or she knows everything she needs to. It includes details of the current state of the project, Directions for future development, and recommendations for new tools and programs that may be useful for this project (this project will be referred to as Table Talk, which is a temporary name).

---
## Project Overview

Table talk is a project that focuses on teaching refugee students Dutch. With as a main goal to create an immersive and engaging environment that helps with the language learning process.
To achieve this I personally chose for using a combination of VR and AI. But this is adaptable.

## Project Status and Current Findings

The project thus far has involved research into API's like Inworld.ai, Whisper and 11Labs, User tests, a proof of concept. And is currently in the phase of developing a MVP. 

The current status is a working proof of concept. In which I have incorporated 2 methods I found.
1 being [Inworld.Ai](Inworld.Ai.md) and the other being a combination of API's, which include [11labs](11Labs.md), [ChatGPT](ChatGTPT%20API.md) and [Whisper](Whisper.md). To get a more detailed explanation of their pro's and con's check out my [Option Research](OptionResearch.md)but to summarize: Inworld.Ai is amazing, it is everything we need to make this project work. But there is one major catch, It does not support Dutch. And the API method is more dynamic and very cool but it is too slow to create a proper conversational NPC.

## Future Directions

In the future the main thing to continue with project wise would be refining the MVP. However if someone were to continue this project they should first check Inworld.Ai's updates in case they added the support for Dutch. Since all of these AI technologies are very new and rapidly developing it is very possible that new tools have appeared, so I recommend doing research into new tools first.

## New Tools and Technology to Consider

As said before the tools and technologies that are useful for this project are rapidly evolving. This means there is no real tool I can currently recommend other than Inworld.Ai. 
Besides that the other AI tools and API's are also improving, probably in speed too. This would make the second method more viable too.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

All that is said before makes my recommendations very easy. As I highly recommend Inworld.Ai. As for the best practices, keep the teachers you are making the project for in the loop. Keep them up to date on everything you find. And test your project with its target audience more often than I did.

## Closing Notes

I think Table Talk is a really cool project with a lot of potential, not only in Dutch language learning to refugees. And I hope that when it moves into its next phases it gets picked up by someone who thinks the same. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
