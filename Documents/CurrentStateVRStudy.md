# Literature Study: Virtual Reality Technology in Language Learning

## Introduction

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that simulates realistic environments and allows users to interact with them. VR can be used to learn languages by conversing with native speakers, visiting different places, and gaining confidence in speaking. VR language learning is more engaging, efficient, and motivating than traditional methods. However, VR language learning is still a new and limited option that many learners are not aware of.

The aim of this literature study is to answer the following question:

- What is the current state of research on the use of virtual reality technology in language learning, and how does it compare to traditional language learning methods in terms of effectiveness and engagement?

To answer this question, we will use the Dot framework, which consists of four steps: Define, Observe, Theorize, and Test.

## Define

In this step, we will define the key concepts and terms related to our research question.

- Virtual reality (VR): A technology that creates an immersive and interactive simulation of a real or imagined environment, using devices such as headsets, controllers, or smartphones.
- Language learning: The process of acquiring or improving one's ability to communicate in a foreign or second language, through various methods such as instruction, practice, exposure, or feedback.
- Effectiveness: The degree to which a language learning method achieves its intended outcomes, such as improving learners' proficiency, accuracy, fluency, or comprehension.
- Engagement: The degree to which a language learning method stimulates learners' interest, attention, motivation, or enjoyment.

## Observe

In this step, we will observe the existing literature and evidence on the use of VR technology in language learning, and summarize the main findings and gaps.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Using virtual reality in language teaching](https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2022/05/31/augmented-virtual-reality-language-teaching/) | A podcast episode that discusses the potential of augmented and virtual reality for language learning and teaching. | - AR and VR can facilitate multimodal, authentic, and situated language learning inside and outside the classroom. <br> - AR and VR can enhance learners' vocabulary acquisition, especially for young children. <br> - AR and VR can increase learners' motivation, confidence, and autonomy. | - The podcast does not provide specific examples or evidence of how AR and VR can improve language learning outcomes. <br> - The podcast does not address the challenges or limitations of using AR and VR in language teaching contexts. |
| [Virtual reality in remote language teaching](https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2020/10/27/virtual-reality-in-remote-language-teaching/) | A blog post that shares the author's experience using virtual reality in remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. | - VR can enable learners to visit museums and see real works of art from other countries. <br> - VR can provide learners with opportunities to interact with native speakers and practice their speaking skills. <br> - VR can create a sense of presence and immersion for learners who are isolated at home. | - The blog post does not report any data or feedback from the learners who participated in the VR activities. <br> - The blog post does not compare the VR activities with other remote teaching methods or tools. |
| [The Effects of Virtual Reality-Assisted Language Learning: A Meta-Analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/6/3147) | A meta-analysis that examines the effects of VR-assisted language learning on learners' performance and attitude. | - VR-assisted language learning has a positive effect on learners' performance compared to traditional methods. <br> - VR-assisted language learning has a positive effect on learners' attitude compared to traditional methods. <br> - The effects of VR-assisted language learning vary depending on the type of VR device, the type of language skill, the level of learner involvement, and the duration of intervention. | - The meta-analysis only includes studies published in English or Chinese until 2019. <br> - The meta-analysis does not consider other factors that may influence the effects of VR-assisted language learning, such as learner characteristics, teacher roles, or pedagogical design. |
| [The Language Learnerâ€™s Guide to Virtual Reality](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/virtual-reality-language-learning/) | A blog post that provides an overview of how virtual reality can be used for language learning purposes. | - VR can offer learners access to immersive and authentic language environments that are otherwise inaccessible or expensive. <br> - VR can expose learners to different cultures and perspectives that can enrich their language learning experience. <br> - VR can help learners overcome their fear or anxiety of speaking in a foreign language. | - The blog post does not cite any sources or evidence to support its claims. <br> - The blog post does not mention any drawbacks or challenges of using VR for language learning. |

## Theorize

In this step, we will theorize the possible explanations and implications of the observed findings and gaps, and formulate hypotheses or research questions for further investigation.

- One possible explanation for the positive effects of VR-assisted language learning is that VR provides a high level of immersion, interaction, and involvement, which are key characteristics of effective language learning environments.
- One possible implication of the observed findings is that VR technology can be a valuable tool for language teachers and learners, especially in situations where traditional methods are not feasible or desirable, such as during the pandemic or in remote areas.
- One possible hypothesis for further investigation is that VR-assisted language learning can improve learners' intercultural competence and awareness, as well as their linguistic skills.
- One possible research question for further investigation is how to design and implement VR-assisted language learning activities that are pedagogically sound, learner-centered, and context-sensitive.

## Test

In this step, we will test our hypotheses or research questions by conducting empirical studies or experiments, and evaluating the results and implications.

- To test our hypothesis that VR-assisted language learning can improve learners' intercultural competence and awareness, we could conduct an experimental study with two groups of learners: one group using VR to learn a foreign language and culture, and another group using a traditional method. We could measure their intercultural competence and awareness before and after the intervention using a validated instrument, such as the Intercultural Development Inventory, and compare the results between the two groups.
- To answer our research question on how to design and implement VR-assisted language learning activities, we could conduct a design-based research study with a group of teachers and learners who are interested in using VR for language learning purposes. We could collaborate with them to design, implement, evaluate, and refine VR activities that are aligned with their goals, needs, preferences, and contexts. We could collect data from multiple sources, such as interviews, observations, surveys, or artifacts, and analyze them using a thematic approach.

## Conclusion

Currently VR in education is a growing field, both in general and as a language learning tool. However it is still very much evolving and improving. Also its effectiveness is not set in stone yet. But it seems to be a large improvement (mostly in engagement) compared to learning from books.

Based on the literature review using the Dot framework, we can conclude that:

- VR technology has the potential to enhance language learning outcomes and experiences by providing immersive, interactive, and authentic environments.
- VR technology has shown positive effects on learners' performance and attitude compared to traditional methods, but these effects may depend on various factors such as the type of device, skill, involvement, or intervention.
- VR technology is still a new and limited option for language learning that many teachers and learners are not familiar with or have access to.
- VR technology requires further research and development to address the existing gaps and challenges in terms of pedagogy, design, implementation, evaluation, and accessibility.
